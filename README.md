# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?
One way to gain information on the user needs is through creating a user persona of either a specific category of user or a specific user themself. User personas create a visual representation of the user's personality and specific interests. These are then used for personalizing user requirements to target development efforts at the needs of those specific users. User stories are used to define these requirements, or expected results, in a concise way. They break all the requirements down into small chucks of functionality, so they can be developed incrementally. 

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
In developing programs, using an agile approach optimizes flow and therefore maximizes efficiency. This is done through the use of small batch sizes, just-in-time production, and concurrent processing. By working in iterations, small batch sizes break up the work into small chunks or bursts of effort. Requirements are defined as more information is gained just-in-time for development. Continuous integration and concurrent testing allow for changes to be easily incorporated into development as it is happening. Catching bugs/issues with testing during development as opposed to at the end of development is another important part of the agile process.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member in software development reflects and demonstrates core values including Commitment and Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage. Fully engaging in the development process, having open, transparent communication with all members, and respecting each other, all help create a highly collaborative environment in which high-quality products can be developed.
